Go interface for MOSEK
======================

This is a thin Go interface for MOSEK.

Currently implemented:

- Nearly all relevant functions (and a lot of more or less useless ones) are mapped
- Stream printing callbacks
- Progress and information callbacks

What will probably never be supported:

- General convex API
